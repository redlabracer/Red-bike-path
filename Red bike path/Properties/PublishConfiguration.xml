# Red Bike Path - Customizable Bike Lane Colors

Transform your city's cycling infrastructure with customizable bike path colors! This mod allows you to change the surface color of bike paths, bike lanes, and cycle ways from the default green to various colors including red, blue, purple, orange, and more.

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 Multiple Color Presets
- **Red** - High visibility for urban areas
- **Blue** - Modern and calming aesthetic
- **Purple** - Unique and distinctive
- **Orange** - Warm and inviting
- **Yellow** - Maximum visibility
- **Pink** - Playful and modern
- **Brown** - Natural and understated
- **White** - Clean and minimal
- **Black** - Sleek and professional
- **Green** - Return to default

### ⚙️ Advanced Settings
- **Color Intensity Slider** - Fine-tune the color strength (0-100%)
- **Only Bike Lanes Mode** - Skip mixed bike+pedestrian paths to avoid coloring pedestrian areas
- **Color Mixed Paths Option** - Choose whether to color shared bike/pedestrian surfaces
- **Separate Pedestrian Control** - Keep pedestrian walkways in their original color

### 🛣️ What Gets Colored
- Dedicated bike lanes on roads
- Separated bike paths
- Cycle way surfaces
- Optional: Mixed bike/pedestrian paths (configurable)

### 🚫 What Stays Original
- Pure pedestrian sidewalks (always)
- Mixed paths (when disabled in settings)
- Road surfaces
- Buildings and other infrastructure

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Enable the mod** in the game's mod manager
2. **Load or start a city** - colors apply automatically
3. **Customize settings** via Options → Mod Settings → Red Bike Path
   - Choose your preferred color preset
   - Adjust intensity for subtle or bold effects
   - Toggle mixed path coloring as desired
4. **Changes apply in real-time** - no restart needed for color changes!

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Color Preset
Select from 10 different color options to match your city's theme

### Color Intensity
Adjust from 0% (no change) to 100% (full saturation) for perfect customization

### Only Bike Lanes (Skip Mixed Paths)
When enabled, skips mixed bike+pedestrian paths to avoid coloring pedestrian areas. May also skip some pure bike paths due to naming patterns.

### Color Mixed Bike+Pedestrian Paths
When enabled, colors mixed paths where bikes and pedestrians share the same surface.
**⚠️ Warning:** This will also color the pedestrian areas since the game uses one material for the entire mixed path.

## 🔧 Technical Details

- Works by modifying material colors at runtime
- No permanent changes to game files
- Compatible with most other mods
- Minimal performance impact
- Automatically updates when settings change

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- Mixed bike/pedestrian paths use a single material, so the entire path (including pedestrian areas) gets colored when enabled
- Some bike paths may not be detected if they use non-standard naming
- Color changes may take a few seconds to apply after game load

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Colors not applying?**
- Wait a few seconds after loading the city
- Check that the mod is enabled in the mod manager
- Verify color intensity is above 0%
- Try switching to a different color preset and back

**Pedestrian areas getting colored?**
- Disable "Color Mixed Bike+Pedestrian Paths" in settings
- Enable "Only Bike Lanes" for maximum filtering

**Performance issues?**
- Reduce color intensity
- Disable mixed path coloring
